      Located in the Old Port of Montreal, Completely Secure Gallery is proud to
      finally share its rich history online with the rest of the world! Here at
      CSG, we take pride in sharing beautiful artworks from local and
      international artists alike. Completely Secure Gallery was founded in 1972
      by two longtime friends: Vincenzo Spaghetti, a gallery agent, and Nico
      Pastrami, a painter. Both shared the common desire to create a designated
      area in the heart of the Quartier International de Montreal for various
      artists to display their artwork. Our mandate, since day 1, has been to
      discover emerging artists and to help the public discover them as well. We
      also wish to help the public discover established, modern artists, may
      they be Canadian or international artists. We wish to do so through
      exhibits and meetings in our 6,000 sq foot space.

      We've always taken pride connecting local artists with potential customers
      by showcasing their work at the gallery. The current pandemic has forced
      us to change our way of doing things. Luckily for us, the extremely
      talented developpers at Group07&#174; have helped us by developing this
      online system to connect us to the rest of the world.

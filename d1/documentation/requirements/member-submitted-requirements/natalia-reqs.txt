R1 - I think just change 'its record' to 'his/her record' and 'since its registration' to 'his/her registration'. Also, req overall could be shortened like 'The Sys shall generated an accounting report for the artist by retrieving his/her record of art pieces sold since his/her registration'

R2 - It's good, I am just not sure if it's too many things in one req

R3 - just add 'after receiving confirmation from shipping company' at the end

R4 - nothing to say at the moment

R5 - again, just change 'its registration' to 'his/her'

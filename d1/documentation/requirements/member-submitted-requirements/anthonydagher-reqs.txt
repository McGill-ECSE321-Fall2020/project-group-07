R1 - I think it's better to say "capable of processing 'a' user's requests ... " because it could be interpreted currently as processing the requests of all the users logged into the system at the moment.

R2 - same as R1, 'upon a user's request'

R3 - see R2

R4 - just to be explicit, add 'update artwork availability after its purchase ...' to be certain that we are talking about updating the artwork that's sold

R5 - I think stick to either piece or artwork rather than introducing items as a new word, also not terribly sure about basket. I think your main idea could still be conveyed without the basket, "display number of orders of a customer on each page ..."

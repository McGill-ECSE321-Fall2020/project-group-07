## Project Overview
This project develops an Online Gallery System to help a Montreal gallery promote local artists during the pandemic. In this system, artists create their personal profiles and upload their artworks. Each day, artists receive an update on the total number of views on their artworks by customers. Customers can browse available artworks either by artist, randomly, or by chronological order. Once a customer purchases an artwork, they then have the option of specifying a delivery to their home or a pickup at the physical address of the gallery itself. The administrator of the Online Gallery System has access to a log of all past purchases and shipments for record-keeping and also troubleshooting

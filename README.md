## The Team

##### Anthony Dagher: U2 Software Engineering student. Like others, I am still learning as much as I can about software development and coding in general. I'm hoping to gain useful knowledge (applicable in the real world) through this project, as well as improve teamworking skills.

##### Jay Han:  U4 Mechanical Engineering minoring in Software. Interest in Computer Vision and ML in general. Excited to apply Agile project management techniques.

##### Keon Olsz: 

##### Massimo Vadacchino:

##### Natalia Tabet: U3 electrical engineering student with minor in software engineering. By combining software and electrical engineering fields I hope to gain a broader insight on the overall architecture and design of intelligent systems such as robotics and automation. 

## The Project

In teams of five students, you will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those
requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release
pipeline to automate the software delivery process. All functionality of the system needs
to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders. In addition, a mobile (Android) frontend shall
allow the execution of the most important functionality for the given stakeholder, i.e. it shall have both read and
write access to the backend via RESTful service calls.
